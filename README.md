# Plotly_BellyButton

## Overview of project
There was a project on studying the bacteria found on the belly button. We were told to arrange the data of the people who were in the experiment.
For this project we created 3 charts. Bar chart, Bubble, and gauge chart.
The main point was to create an interactive website to change all the charts according on my selection of the personÂ´s ID.
## Results
This is the final website!
